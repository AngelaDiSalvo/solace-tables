With more time I would:

1. add pagination to the api and table. Limit to 100 results on page load.
2. add search to the api.
3. once search is moved to the api, the onChange logic needs to stop DOM filtering. Filter moves to only upon api calls.
4. add quick filtering to the UI to allow for key-word searching. City, Degree, and Specialty would be popular quick filters.
5. way more styling. "Searching for:" section seems redundant from a user perspective. Good for coding assignments, less good for actual UX.
